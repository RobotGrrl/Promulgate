**Promulgate**

Promulgate is an Arduino library with a very simple protocol to allow communication from Arduino to other devices.

For example: you can set up an Arduino with a button, and a Processing sketch that changes its background colour. Add Promulgate code to the Arduino and Processing sketch to glue both of them together!
